    <h2> Hi, I'm Adhithyan ðŸ‘‹</h2>
    <p>
I am a computer engineering student from Kerala, India, passionate about coding and exploring software and web development. I began coding in 2019, mostly in Scratch. I have basic knowledge of C programming, SQL, JavaScript, and CSS. My goals include enhancing my skills, building a strong portfolio, and contributing to open-source projects while collaborating with other developers.
